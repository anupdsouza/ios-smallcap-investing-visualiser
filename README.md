# Small cap investing visualiser app for iOS 

An iOS app based on [Mr. Shankar Nath's](https://www.youtube.com/@shankarnath) Small Cap Investing Strategy [video on YouTube.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppxnjQ86T-Q)

The app supports `iOS 15.0` and above and is built using `Xcode 14.2`

Download or clone the repository to view the source code. Build and run the app either on the iOS simulator or on a physical device.
Once installed you will see the **Small Cap Inv** app icon on the dashboard, tap to launch the app.
The app uses `Combine` framework to make network requests to the `niftyindices.com` API and displays the TRI in the UI on receiving a successful response.
Note that the TRI displayed is of the `previous day` only.
